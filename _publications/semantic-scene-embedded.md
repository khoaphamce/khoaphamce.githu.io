collection: publications
permalink: /publication/semantic-scene-embedded
excerpt: 'This paper proposed a method to optimize 3D semantic scene completion model using structural pruning approach. Our goal is to reduce computation complexity and increase performance of the model on embedded system. We achieved a 32% increment in FPS, testing on Jetson Xavier NX computer.'
